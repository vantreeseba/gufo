Peak measured workloads; text pp is autoregressive (AR), while tg uses the
named speculative mode. Peaks include repetitive output; aggregate tg sums
individual request decode rates. Qwen27B's single-user peak uses the short-prompt
C1 workload. Audio excludes loading.
Each model guide lists the required files and complete benchmark settings.

## Philosophy

- Contributions are welcome! We need the help of Strix Halo community to keep improving gufo!
- We would like this to be the one-stop shop for Strix Halo Local AI enthusiasts: batteries included for text, audio, image, and video models.
- Build and optimize specifically for the Strix Halo 128 GiB hardware. Smaller memory configurations should still work and preserve the speed benefits for models that can fit on memory.
- Support only the best available models for their size that can run on this hardware: less code to maintain, more focused optimization and testing work.
- Preserve quality when optimizing. Each model's quality report records independent numerical checks, execution consistency and unresolved gaps. Don't reuse kernels across different models to limit blast radius of a code change.
- Treat concurrent requests, cancellation and conversation caching as first-class workloads.
- Keep production dependencies small and development tools separate.

Rootless Podman needs `crun` for `--group-add keep-groups`. Your host user must
have read/write access to `/dev/kfd` and `/dev/dri/renderD*`, usually through the
`render` and `video` groups; log out and back in after changing membership.
Container groups named `video`/`render` do not preserve host supplementary
groups. Check `id`, `ls -l /dev/kfd /dev/dri/renderD*`, and
`podman info --format '{{.Host.OCIRuntime.Name}}'` if ROCm reports no device.
See [Podman's rootless group-access guidance](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/troubleshooting.md#20-passed-in-devices-or-files-cant-be-accessed-in-rootless-container).

On Fedora or another SELinux-enforcing host, GPU enumeration can succeed while
SELinux blocks mapping `/dev/kfd`, causing ROCr to report a misleading
“Memory critical” error. Check the **host** audit log:

```sh
sudo ausearch -m avc -ts recent | grep -E '/dev/kfd|hsa_device_t'
```

If it shows a denied `map` for the container, Podman documents this fix:

```sh
sudo setsebool -P container_use_devices true
```

This persistently allows containers to access device labels for devices passed
into them; it affects all containers on that host. Review that policy scope
before enabling it. See [Podman's device documentation](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-run.1.html#device-host-device-container-device-permissions)
and the [SELinux container policy](https://github.com/containers/container-selinux/blob/main/container.te).

Then, from another terminal, ask it something through the OpenAI-compatible API:

```sh
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "Qwen3.8-27B-UD-Q8_K_XL",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Say something"}]
  }'
```

For Open WebUI, VS Code, OpenAI SDK and Responses-API clients (for example
Codex), set the API base URL to `http://localhost:8080/v1`. Chat Completions and
Responses support text, images, function tools, structured output and streaming.
See the [API contract](docs/SERVER.md).

The text server uses the model's native context by default and generates until
EOS or the context is full. `--context N` sets context capacity per session;
`--max-tokens N` sets a default response limit that clients can override.
Reasoning tokens count toward that response limit.

## Harness notes

- **Qwen with Codex:** Codex sends developer messages mid-conversation, after
  compaction or a settings change. Qwen's template accepts only one leading
  system turn, so Gufo moves them there. The request that introduces one is
  prefilled again; later requests reuse the cache. See the
  [API contract](docs/SERVER.md).

## Build from source

Linux x86-64 on AMD Strix Halo (`gfx1151`) is the supported target. CMake owns
one production configuration for both Nix and ordinary Linux builds. Tests,
profilers, tuning executables and Python reference runners are not installed
with the production package. No `build.sh` wrapper is needed.

### With Nix

```sh
nix build
./result/bin/gufo diagnose
./result/bin/gufo serve llm --model /path/to/model.gguf
```

[flake.lock](flake.lock) pins the dependencies. `nix develop` adds profiling,
model-download and independent evaluation tools; these are not runtime
requirements. Optional benchmark baselines are selected separately with
`nix shell .#ds4-reference`, `.#llama-cpp-reference` or
`.#llama-cpp-mtp-reference`; see [benchmarking](docs/BENCHMARKS.md).
See [testing](docs/TESTING.md) for the small hosted CI suite and
explicit local quality checks.

### Without Nix

Install a C++20 compiler, CMake 3.21+, Ninja, pkg-config and the
following development libraries. The currently qualified toolchain is GCC
15.3 and ROCm 7.2.3. Attention and audio convolution kernels are compiled
directly from HIP. Python, Triton/AOTriton, Composable Kernel and MIOpen are
not production build or runtime requirements.

| Dependency | Used for |
| --- | --- |
| ROCm HIP compiler/runtime, hipBLAS, hipBLASLt, rocBLAS | GPU execution and matrix multiplication |
| hipCUB, rocPRIM, rocWMMA headers | Compiled GPU kernels |
| ICU, libcurl, OpenSSL, libpng, libjpeg, libwebp | Tokenization, HTTPS, hashing and images |
| FFmpeg and ffprobe | Video/audio output; invoked as separate executables |

Install ROCm using [AMD's Linux instructions](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/).
Use the development packages for the libraries above. ROCm normally installs
under `/opt/rocm`.

For example, on Debian/Ubuntu the ordinary system libraries are:

```sh
sudo apt install build-essential cmake ninja-build pkg-config \
  libicu-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev libpng-dev libjpeg-dev libwebp-dev ffmpeg

# ROCm libraries from the table, named as AMD's repository ships them.
sudo apt install hipblas-dev hipblaslt-dev rocblas-dev \
  hipcub-dev rocprim-dev rocwmma-dev

cmake --preset release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$HOME/.local"
cmake --build --preset release --parallel 4
./build/release/gufo diagnose
./build/release/gufo serve llm --model /path/to/model.gguf
```

Configuring fails at `find_package(hipblas)` when those ROCm packages are
missing. Other distributions name them `-devel` instead of `-dev`.
For nonstandard installations, pass ordinary CMake paths, for example
`cmake --preset release -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/opt/rocm"`.
If compiler discovery picks a system Clang, also pass
`-DCMAKE_HIP_COMPILER=/opt/rocm/llvm/bin/clang++`.
Use `cmake --install build/release` to install Gufo,
its runtime data and license notices. The GPU driver must allow your user to
access `/dev/kfd` and `/dev/dri`; model weights are acquired separately.

The same source, compiler flags and install rules serve both builds. Nix pins
the complete toolchain for reproducible comparisons; changing the compiler or
math libraries requires the affected model's quality checks.
